Code related to the machine learning client goes in this folder.
The model code is modified, so we need to copy the full code to our project folder.
Can't lock the Pipfile via pipenv install, since the model depends on too many other packages, and there are some conflicts. Can't resolve it for now
Use requirement.txt instead.
